            <b>The Tabli popup window is back!</b>
            <br>
            Last month I shipped an update to confom to new Chrome Extension
            <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/manifest-v2-phase-out-begins.html">requirements</a>.
            An unfortunate part of that update was removal of the in-browser popup window.
            <br>
            Feedback from the community was swift and clear: the popup window is a critical feature for many users.
            <br>
            With today's update I'm pleased to report that, after a lot of painstaking work, the popup window is back!
