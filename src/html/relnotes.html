            <span>What's New (3.0.1):</span>
            <br>
            This release updates Tabli  
            to the latest extension manifest format (V3) and a service worker, a 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/manifest-v2-phase-out-begins.html">mandatory requirement</a> for
            all Chrome extensions.
            <p>
            As a consequence of this update, Tabli now only supports a free-standing popout window.
            While this has been the recommended way to use Tabli for many years, until now Tabli
            also continued to support an in-browser popup window.
            <P>
            Unfortunately, continuing to
            support the in-browser popup window would have required a complete rewrite of Tabli's
            internals, which was not feasible.
            <p>
            I did not make this change lightly, and explored all reasonable options for
            avoiding this change. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
