            <b>The Tabli popup window is back!</b>
            <br>
            Last month I was <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/manifest-v2-phase-out-begins.html">forced</a> 
            to ship an update with an unfortunate side effect: it removed the in-browser popup window.
            <br>
            Feedback from the community was swift and clear: the popup window is a critical feature for many users.
            <br>
            I'm pleased to report that, after a lot of painstaking work, the popup window is back!
